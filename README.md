Obstacle Avoiding Robot - https://github.com/SConaway/ObstacleAvoidingRobot/

Based on:
===
*  Arduino UNO R3
*  L298N motor driver

Once code is uploaded, this becomes a remote-controlled robot.

I based it off of https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M2Z9ZTV/ with my own custom shield. Everything is the same for the IR Robot.
